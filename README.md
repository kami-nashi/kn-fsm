Figure Skating Metrics

The google sheets I was using for tracking time and expense was just
not keeping up, so I decided to attpemt to create my own solution.

Requires MariaDB/MySQL, PHP, any webserver
Uses Bootstrap for front end prettiness

This has been predominately used to help budget for my own time and track
how many hours I have before my blades may need sharpened.

Bugs:
  Month to month comparison does not work if last month is in previous year.
  UI is very broken in Mobile browsers

TODO:
  Journal entries via submission form
  Track punch cards across multiple rinks
  Simplified punch display
  Add Costs of punch cards as sub item of Ice Time reports
  Skill development and tracking
  QR Input for repetitive Items
